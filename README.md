This dataset includes transaction-level data such as:

📆 Order Date, Ship Date

🛍 Category, Sub-Category

🌍 Region, State, City

💳 Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount

📦 Ship Mode, Segment


# 📊 Objectives

Identify top-performing regions, states, and cities

Analyze the impact of discounts on profit

Visualize sales vs. profit trends

Explore shipping modes and their effect on performance

# 🛠 Tools & Libraries

Matplotlib – Plotting

Seaborn – Statistical visualization

# 🔍 Key Insights
